A Git revision is a specific point in the history of a Git repository. It can be a branch name, a tag or a commit SHA.

- **Branch Name**: A branch is a pointer to a specific commit, which moves as new commits are added, for example, `main` or `develop` branches.
- **Commit SHA**: Every commit in Git has a unique SHA-1 hash, which is a 40-character string. You can use this hash to refer to a specific commit. For example, `e9f227c9a4c5c9a72134a6cb23a7e4e1e4a6d18a`. You can also use the SHA's prefix to refer to it, like `e9f227c` for this example.
- **Tags**: A tag is a reference to a specific commit, often used to mark release points like `v1.0.0`.

To learn more about Git revisions, you can read the [official Git documentation on revisions](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions).
