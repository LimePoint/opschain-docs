# Support

This page details the support policy in relation to the OpsChain product under the terms of the [LimePoint End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://opschain.io/eula).

Two types of support offerings are available subject to the type of licence under which OpsChain is being used.

1. Community (free demo) - for users who are trialling OpsChain under a demo licence
2. Enterprise (paid licence) - for enterprise organisations who adopt OpsChain for business purposes

## Community (free demo licence)

### Business hours

Our support team is available from 9am - 5pm Monday to Friday (AEDT).

### Best efforts support

All support offered is best efforts - no guarantees are made that the support team will resolve your issue, nor the timeframe in which you may receive a solution or fix.

### What is included

Please refer to the [troubleshooting](/troubleshooting.md) guide on how to resolve known issues within OpsChain. If you do have any particular concerns, we will endeavour to address and respond to them within a reasonable amount of time. Our support policy also includes the following:

- Logging of issues and requests
- Assistance with issues during installation
- Troubleshooting

### What is not included

- Upgrades or upgrade planning
- Integration with other systems
- Training
- Professional services including consulting advice, project services or development services
- Older version support (see [supported versions](#supported-versions) for more information)

### Concessions

1. We do not provide support after business hours.

2. We will prioritise resolving any critical issues or bugs found when using OpsChain, however, we will not provide an estimated response time for when those fixes will become available, nor do we guarantee they will be resolved in our next release.

3. Our scope of support only applies to OpsChain. This does not cover our product's ability to interact with other products such as third party software. However, we are happy to take note of these issues and provide assistance where possible.

### Using OpsChain in production

We do not recommend using the OpsChain SaaS demo in your production environments, and do so at your own risk.

### How to contact us

For any support-related enquiries, please contact us via the [`#opschain-support` Slack channel](https://limepoint.slack.com/messages/opschain-support) that you have been added to as part of the demo, or email opschain-support@limepoint.com.

### Ongoing support

Our OpsChain support team will continue to provide assistance until your demo licence expires.

### Supported versions

We will provide support for the [latest release](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain/releases/latest) and the immediately preceding release only. If you encounter any issues, LimePoint advises that you first upgrade your OpsChain to the latest release. If you are still experiencing issues, please contact support using the above channels.
