# Changelog

## [Unreleased] _(change to yyyy-mm-dd format before release, e.g. 2022-02-25)_

### Added

- OpsChain project Git remote credentials can now be updated using the `opschain project update-git-remote` command.
- OpsChain project and environment properties can now be edited using the `opschain project edit-properties` and `opschain environment edit-properties` commands.

### Fixed

- The OpsChain CLI `opschain server deploy` command has been fixed on Windows.
  - **Breaking change** - the `.env` file has moved from using double quotes around values to single quotes to fix an issue with Windows paths containing special character sequences like `\n` - which was being treated as a newline.
    - If your .env file contains values containing `"`, they need to be unescaped and the surrounding `"` changed to `'`. Similarly, any value containing a `'` now needs to have the single quotes escaped. Rerunning a [full configuration](/docs/reference/cli.md#full-configuration) may be simpler.
- Removed the text colour presentation from the masked fields in the `add-git-remote` and `list-git-remotes` command output when displayed in `json` or `yaml` format.

## 2022-09-20

### Changed

- As part of OpsChain moving out of the trial phase, the default Kubernetes namespace has been updated to `opschain` and the documentation repository has been moved to [`opschain`](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain).
- Properties validation in OpsChain has been improved. Formerly properties validation was only applied when a step started running. Now, properties validation is also applied:
  - when project or environment properties are set (via the API or CLI). Detailed errors will be provided (via the API or CLI) if the properties fail validation.
  - after an OpsChain action modifies project or environment properties. If the modifications cause the properties to fail validation, the change will error and detailed errors will be reported in the change logs.
- The `change create --follow-logs` and `change show-logs` commands now support the `--output` argument, allowing you to output the logs in `text` (default) or `json` format.

### Fixed

- The OpsChain Helm chart no longer deploys a cluster role or cluster role binding for the OpsChain ingress service account. The role and binding are now included with the Kong v2.12.0 Helm deployment.

## 2022-09-15

### Important breaking change

- The OpsChain step runner Dockerfile template has been changed. After upgrading, please use `opschain dev create-dockerfile` to create a copy of the new template in your project's `.opschain` folder and then reapply your customisations.
- The OpsChain server management commands (`bin/*`) have been removed from the `opschain-trial` repository. They have been replaced by `opschain server` subcommands.
- The `opschain_auth/security_configuration.json` file must be moved out of the `opschain_auth` folder and stored in the same folder as the `.env` and `values.yaml` files, e.g. `mv opschain_auth/security_configuration.json .`

### Added

- The OpsChain CLI now supports an optional `--output` argument for many operations, allowing you to display the command's output in different formats (e.g. YAML / JSON). See the relevant command's `--help` output for the available formats.
- Default output format(s) can be configured via your `.opschainrc` file. See the [OpsChain CLI reference](/docs/reference/cli.md#opschain-cli-configuration-settings) for more information.
- The `opschain change retry` command now accepts a `--background` argument, allowing you to retry the change in the background.
- OpsChain now supports loading environment specific repository properties. See the [Git repository](/docs/reference/concepts/properties.md#git-repository) section of the properties guide for more information.
- OpsChain can now be configured to support running concurrent changes for a single project environment. See the [change execution options](/docs/reference/concepts/changes.md#change-execution-options) section of the changes reference guide for more information.
- The OpsChain CLI has new subcommands for managing and configuring OpsChain server installations under `opschain server`, e.g. `opschain server configure` - [learn more](/docs/reference/cli.md#server-management).
- The `opschain server` commands support a `values.override.yaml` file for automatically applying Helm customisations.

### Changed

- When the available log lines for a single request (via `/log_lines` with a filter or via `changes/<change_id>/log_lines`) exceeds the limit for a single request - a `more` link is provided to navigate to the next chunk.
- Upgraded cert-manager to 1.9.1.
- Upgraded Fluent Bit to v1.9.8.
- Upgraded HashiCorp Vault to 1.11.3 in the OpsChain Vault example.
- Upgraded Kong Helm chart to v2.12.0.
- Upgraded Kong Ingress Controller to v2.5.0.
- Upgraded OPA to v0.44.0.
- Upgraded OpsChain Log Aggregator Image to Fluentd 1.15.1.
- Upgraded PostgreSQL to 14.5.
- Upgraded Terraform to 1.2.9 in the OpsChain examples.
- Upgraded Terraform 'hashicorp/aws' provider to 4.29.0 in the OpsChain Ansible example.
- Upgraded BuildKit to v0.10.4.

### Fixed

- The `opschain dev build-runner-image` command now supplies the `OPSCHAIN_VERSION` build argument to Docker when building your custom step runner image.

### Removed

- **Breaking change** - The OpsChain CLI `opschain dev` commands no longer recognise the `OPSCHAIN_VERSION` environment variable when starting the development environment or building runner images. Ensure you have the corresponding version of the CLI to access the required OpsChain images, e.g. to use the `2022-08-16` OpsChain images, use the `2022-08-16` version of the CLI.
- The `bin/opschain-*` commands have been removed from the `opschain-trial` repository - they have been replaced by the `opschain server` subcommands as described above. _Note: the `opschain server` commands do not need to be run in the `opschain-trial` directory. You can now move the existing configuration files (the `.env`, `values.yaml`, and `opschain_auth/security_configuration.json` files) into a folder of your choosing and run the commands from there. Please ensure as part of the move, that you move the `opschain_auth/security_configuration.json` file out of the `opschain_auth` folder per the instructions above (under "important breaking change")._

## 2022-08-16

### Important breaking change

- OpsChain environments codes are no longer globally unique and can now be reused in different projects. With this change, the `/environments` API endpoint has been removed. Please use the `/projects/<project_code>/environments` endpoint for all future environment specific API access.
  - *_Note: Due to the endpoint changes, please ensure you are using the latest OpsChain CLI version._*

## 2022-08-12

### Fixed

- The `error: cannot lock ref` error that occurred when multiple changes were executed for the same Git remote has been fixed.

## 2022-08-10

### Important breaking change

- The OpsChain step runner Dockerfile template has been changed. After upgrading, please use `opschain dev create-dockerfile` to create a copy of the new template in your project's `.opschain` folder and then reapply your customisations.

### Added

- The OpsChain CLI now allows you to build a step runner image from your project's `.opschain/Dockerfile` via the `opschain dev build-runner-image` command. See [custom runner images](/docs/development-environment.md#custom-runner-images) for more details on using the image in your OpsChain development environment.

### Changed

- The `opschain project add-git-remote` command will now display the Git remote details rather than the text `Git remote added successfully`.

### Fixed

- The image registry garbage collector now handles error conditions that may have caused runner images to be garbage collected prematurely.
- The `opschain change retry` command now follows the change logs when supplied with the `--follow-logs` argument.

## 2022-07-26

*This release is a bugfix for the 2022-07-20 release which is unusable. Please check the release notes for both releases before upgrading.*

### Changed

- The `opschain change create` command `--follow` argument has been renamed to `--follow-logs`.

### Fixed

- The 2022-07-20 release contained a bug that caused it to fail when upgrading existing instances. This release corrects the invalid migration and must be used in place of 2022-07-20.
- The `opschain change create` command now exits with an error code for cancelled or failed changes when using the `--follow-logs` argument. This matches the functionality when this argument is not provided.

## 2022-07-20

*This release has a critical bug and should not be used. Please use release 2022-07-26 instead.**

### Important breaking changes

- The way OpsChain manages its local clone of your project Git repositories has changed to improve support for projects with multiple Git remotes. **You must re-add all active Git remotes for this release**.
  - Use the `opschain project list-git-remotes` command to identify your active Git remotes in each project.
  - Archive each Git remote using the `opschain project archive-git-remote` command.
  - Re-associate each Git remote with the project using the `opschain project add-git-remote` command.

### Added

- The `opschain change create` command now accepts a `--follow` argument, allowing you to follow the change logs rather than view the step tree.

### Removed

- The `Metadata` column has been removed from the `opschain change list` output. To view the metadata, use the `opschain change show` command.

### Changed

- When creating a change, OpsChain now validates the supplied Git remote and revision after the change has been created. If the supplied values are invalid, the change will complete with an error status and the change logs will provide further information.
- Archiving a Git remote will now unschedule any automated change rules related to it.
- Git remotes used by automated change rules can no longer be deleted. Deleting the related automated change rules is now a prerequisite to deleting the Git remote.

## 2022-07-11

## 2022-06-29

### Added

- OpsChain project Git remotes can now be archived using the `opschain project archive-git-remote` command.
- The OpsChain API project `git_remotes` endpoint now accepts `DELETE` requests. _Note: Git remotes  that are associated with changes will have their credentials cleared rather than being deleted._
- Documentation has been added on Git remote operations. [Learn more](/docs/reference/concepts/git-remotes.md).

### Changed

- `PATCH` request on the project `git_remotes` endpoint is now only used for archiving/unarchiving an existing Git remote. Git remote creation has been moved to its `POST` request.
- The `opschain project add-git-remote` command now replaces `opschain project set-git-remote`.

## 2022-06-20

### Added

- `OpsChain.context.change.automated` is now populated in the [OpsChain context](/docs/reference/concepts/context.md) - indicating whether a change was created by an [automated change rule](/docs/reference/concepts/automated-changes.md).
- The `automated` field is now included in the OpsChain changes API response - indicating whether a change was created by an [automated change rule](/docs/reference/concepts/automated-changes.md).

## 2022-06-08

### Important breaking changes

- OpsChain must be installed from scratch for this release. Follow the steps in the [uninstall guide](/docs/operations/uninstall.md) to remove OpsChain and then perform a [fresh install](/docs/operations/installation.md). The existing Git remotes can be re-used with the new installation.

### Added

- When the list of options for an argument contains a single value, the OpsChain CLI will now automatically select it.
- OpsChain now tracks the Git remote used for a change explicitly.
- OpsChain now tracks the Git remote used for an automated change rule explicitly.

### Changed

### Added

- The `opschain change show-logs` command now supports the `--timestamps` option, to prefix each log line with the date and time it was logged.
- OpsChain now supports [wait steps](/docs/reference/concepts/actions.md#wait-steps) - steps that pause a change execution and wait for a user to continue the change manually.
- CLI version, server version and runner image can be retrieved via the `opschain info` CLI command.
- An `/info` endpoint has been added to the OpsChain API to return the currently running version and runner image.

  - See the [enterprise controllers for Oracle](/docs/reference/opschain-and-mintpress.md#enterprise-controllers-for-oracle) guide for more details.

### Fixed

- Repeated invocations of the `configure` script on macOS have been fixed - they used to fail silently.
- OpsChain runners on Windows and macOS were failing as the log configuration was wrong.

## [2021-09-03]

### Added

- The OpsChain CLI can now:
  - be configured to output the step statuses as text rather than emoji. See the [CLI configuration guide](/docs/reference/cli.md#opschain-cli-configuration-settings) for more details.
  - archive projects and environments. See the [archiving projects & environments guide](/docs/reference/concepts/archiving.md) for more details.
- The OpsChain DSL now supports the `ref` method for referencing other resources. This is useful for cases where a resource name includes special characters, e.g.:

  ```ruby
  infrastructure_host 'test.opschain.io'

  some_resource 'something' do
    host ref('test.opschain.io') # `host test.opschain.io` would fail here
  end
  ```

  - return a boolean `archived` attribute.
  - accept `DELETE` requests. _Note: Only projects and environments with no associated changes can be deleted._
- The OpsChain API `automated_change_rules` endpoint now includes a `next_run_at` attribute containing the time when the rule will next run. See the [automated changes guide](/docs/reference/concepts/automated-changes.md#creating-an-automated-change-rule-for-new-commits) for more information on what happens when an automated change rule runs.
- The `opschain automated-change list` output no longer include the `Project` and `Environment` columns (as these are parameter values to the command) and includes a `Next Run At` column.
- The `opschain-action` command now supports a _best-effort_ mode for running the child steps of an action. See the [child steps](/docs/development-environment.md#child-steps) section of the Docker development environment guide for more details.
- OpsChain now provides an `opschain-lint` command for detecting issues with the OpsChain DSL. Learn more in the [Docker development environment](/docs/development-environment.md#using-opschain-lint) guide.
  - `opschain-lint` is run as part of the default Dockerfile for steps to detect errors sooner - this can be added to custom Dockerfiles, or a custom Dockerfile could be used to remove the linter if it is not desired.

### Fixed

- A rare logging error reported by the OpsChain worker - `(JSON::ParserError) (Excon::Error::Socket)`/`socat[323] E write(., ..., ...): Broken pipe` - has been fixed.

## [2021-08-16]

### Added

- OpsChain now supports events. The `/events` endpoint can be used for reporting and auditing, see the [events](/docs/reference/concepts/events.md) guide for more details.
- The list of configuration in the `.env` file is now documented in the [configuration options](/docs/operations/configuring-opschain.md) guide.
- Changes can now take metadata (JSON structured data) to help identify and track changes.
  - The `opschain change create/retry` commands now takes an optional argument to allow providing the metadata for a change.
    - If provided, the metadata file must contain a JSON object, e.g. `{ "cr": "CR73", "description": "Change request 73 - apply patchset abc to xyz." }`.
  - The `opschain change show/list` commands now include the change metadata.
  - The `/changes` API can now be filtered using the same filtering syntax as events.
    - For example, `?filter[metadata_cr_eq]=CR73` would match all changes with the metadata `{ "cr": "CR73" }`.
    - See the [events filtering](/docs/reference/concepts/events.md#filtering-events) documentation for more details.

### Changed

- Simplified the `.env` file by moving default values to `.env.internal`

## [2021-07-08]

### Added

- The [Oracle WebLogic example](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-weblogic) now includes a sample WAR file and related `deploy`, `redeploy` and `undeploy` actions.

### Fixed

- After waiting for the environment change lock, pending changes will be executed in the order they were created. Previously pending changes could start in any order.

### Removed

- **Breaking change** - The `opschain-auth` container is no longer bound to 8081 by default. This binding can be added by following the steps in the [restricting user access guide](/docs/operations/restricting-user-access.md#expose-opschain-ldap-and-authorisation-service-server-ports).

## [2021-06-16]

### Added

- Docker build logs for the OpsChain step runner image are included in the change/step logs. They will be shown as part of the output of the `opschain change logs-show` command for new changes.

### Changed

- **Breaking change** - The [assign LDAP group](/docs/operations/restricting-user-access.md#assign-ldap-group) ldif example now creates a groupOfNames rather than a posixGroup to support RFC 4519.

  - The convention for CLI subcommands has changed from `noun-verb` to `verb-noun`, for example, `opschain environment properties-set` has been renamed to `opschain environment set-properties`.
- **Breaking change** - The `--commit-ref` and `--ref` options have been renamed to `--git-rev` for consistency. This affects the `opschain change create` and the new `opschain automated-change create` commands.
- **Breaking change** - The `GIT_REF` ARG in custom Dockerfiles has been renamed to `GIT_SHA` - this means that if the Git sha the Git reference points to is altered during a change the steps will still use the original commit (sha).
- `GIT_REV` is now an environment variable that is assigned (with the `git_rev` value of the change) when using the default step runner.
  - A `GIT_REV` ARG is now provided to custom Dockerfiles - this can be assigned to an environment variable (the custom Dockerfile template demonstrates how this can be done).

  _Note: You will need to recreate any users you had created in the OpsChain LDAP._

## [2021-06-01]

### Added

- The ability to use custom Runner images in the OpsChain Docker development environment. Note that the custom Runner image must have been built as part of an OpsChain change.

### Changed

- **Breaking change** - The OpsChain CLI now uses kebab-case-arguments (rather than snake_case_arguments) so all multi word arguments have changed.

## [2021-05-17]

### Important breaking changes

- the `opschain_db`, `opschain-ldap` and `opschain_project_git_repos` directories have been moved into a new `opschain_data` directory (`opschain_data` can be overridden as part of the `configure` process)
  - you **must** run `configure` after upgrading to reflect the new directory structure in your `.env` file.
- due to the addition of the project code the OpsChain database needs to be removed and recreated.
  - the path to the project Git repositories has changed from `./opschain_project_git_repos/production/<uuid>` to `./opschain_data/opschain_project_git_repos/<uuid>`.

### Added

- a symbolic link is created as part of the project creation, allowing you to navigate to the project's Git repository via `./opschain_data/opschain_project_git_repos/<project code>`
- **Breaking change** - projects now use (and require) a unique project code.
- The OpsChain Terraform resource type now supports version 0.15.

### Removed

- The environment delete API has been removed.
- **Breaking change** - Support for Terraform version 0.14 and lower has been removed from the OpsChain Terraform resource.

## [2021-05-10]

### Added

- OpsChain now supports [automated deployments](/docs/reference/concepts/concepts.md#automated-change-rule) - a way to automatically create OpsChain changes in response to Git changes. See [setting up an automated deployment](/docs/reference/concepts/automated-changes.md) for more information.
- OpsChain now supports [scheduled deployments](/docs/reference/concepts/concepts.md#automated-change-rule) - a way to automatically create OpsChain changes at a scheduled time.

### Changed

- OpsChain now allows properties to be sourced from a project's Git repository. See the updated [OpsChain properties guide](/docs/reference/concepts/properties.md) for more information.
- OpsChain now does a Git [forced fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch#Documentation/git-fetch.txt---force) when fetching a project's Git repository. This means tags can be updated in the remote and reflected in the project Git repository.

## [2021-04-27]

### Added

- An example project for [running an AWS Ansible change](/docs/examples/running-an-aws-ansible-change.md).
- Helper methods available from within actions to store and remove files from project and environment properties. See [storing & removing files](/docs/reference/concepts/properties.md#storing--removing-files) for more details.

### Changed

- OpsChain environments are now locked such that only one change can be run in an environment at a time. Changes will sit in the `pending` state whilst waiting for the existing change to finish.
- The OpsChain properties available via `OpsChain.properties` are frozen, ensuring users receive an error if they attempt to change them (as only `OpsChain.environment.properties` and `OpsChain.project.properties` are persisted)
- The `terraform_config` resource type now:
    1. automatically stores the Terraform state file in the environment properties.
    2. automatically calls terraform init in the OpsChain Runner prior to running Terraform commands.
- The Confluent and Terraform examples now
    - use Terraform v0.14.9.
    - rely on the new automatic features of the `opschain-terraform` resource.

- The OpsChain Runner now uses
    - Ruby v2.7.3. Please make any necessary adjustments to your project's Git repositories to reflect this change.
    - v3.11.1 of the MintPress Controllers.
- **Breaking change** - the OpsChain [files properties](/docs/reference/concepts/properties.md#file-properties) format has changed. Any files stored in your properties will need to be altered to reflect the new format.

  _Note: The `properties-show` and `properties-set` features can be used to download, upload your properties (allowing you to edit your properties locally)._

### Fixed

- Hide internal development tasks from the opschain-utils output.
- OpsChain Runner showing "Connection refused - connect(2) for /var/run/docker.sock.opschain" after container restart.

## [2021-03-31]

### Added

- An example project for [running a simple Terraform change](/docs/examples/running-a-simple-terraform-change.md).
- The Getting Started guide now includes instructions for creating your own action.

### Changed

- The sample data provided as part of the Getting Started guide has been simplified.
- The `.opschain/step_context.json` file is now optional when running `opschain-action` or `opschain-dev`.
- The `terraform_config` resource type passes any `vars` ([Terraform input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html)) supplied to Terraform via a [var file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files).

### Removed

- The [Confluent example](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-confluent) no longer provides the VarFile class as its functionality has been added to the `terraform_config` resource type.

## [2021-03-22]

### Added

- The `opschain-resource-types` gem is now pre-installed in the OpsChain step runner image providing some [resource types](/docs/reference/included-resource-types.md) for the `mintpress-infrastructure` and `ruby-terraform` gems.

  _Please note the [prerequisites](/docs/reference/included-resource-types.md#prerequisites) for the Terraform resource._

### Changed

- Replaced `mintpress-infrastructure` resource types in the [Confluent example](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-confluent) with those provided by the pre-installed `opschain-resource-types` gem in the OpsChain step runner image.
- [Confluent example](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-confluent) Properties
  - Replaced encrypted project properties with unencrypted properties.
  - The host environment for the brokers and control center is now sourced from OpsChain properties.

  _Please note, you will need to [update the project properties](/docs/examples/running-a-complex-change.md#import-the-confluent-example-properties) with the new `project_properties.json` before re-running the example._

- The Terraform binary is now installed in the custom step runner Dockerfile as part of the [OpsChain Confluent example](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-confluent/blob/75473f7fbac4150b3d5c583dfc52c6b22044552f/.opschain/Dockerfile#L8)

- The Terraform binary has been removed from the OpsChain step runner image for parity with other tools which we support but don't bundle.
- Terraform support has been removed from the `opschain-core` gem (Terraform support is now available via the `opschain-resource-types` gem).

## [2021-03-09]

### Added

- Automatically expose [controller actions and properties](/docs/reference/concepts/actions.md#controller-actions-and-properties) in resource types and resources.

- Upgraded OpsChain LDAP image OpenLDAP from version 2.4.50 to 2.4.57
- Upgraded OpsChain DB image postgres from 13.1 to 13.2
- Upgraded OpsChain step runner image Terraform from 0.12.29 to 0.14.7.

_Please note:_

1. Project Git repositories will need to be updated:
    - [Terraform 0.12 -> 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) - will assist in creating a `versions.tf` in your project Git repository(s).
    - [Terraform 0.13 -> 0.14](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-14.html) - provides information on the new `.terraform.lock.hcl` lock file.
2. You will need to [update the environment properties](/docs/examples/running-a-complex-change.md#import-the-confluent-example-properties) with the `environment_properties.json` before re-running the example (to remove the old `tfstate` information).
