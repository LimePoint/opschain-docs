# OpsChain demo

Everyone has a combination of toolchains, and keeping track of changes and determining the state across a mix of DevOps tools is _HARD_. OpsChain is here to help!

OpsChain is a platform whose sole purpose is to _Unify Change_ - connect, automate, and orchestrate people, processes, and tools across your on-premise and cloud platforms.

## OpsChain features include

## Getting started

Keen to get started? We have a [getting started guide](/docs/getting_started/README.md) which lists technical requirements and helps you to get going. You will also find several examples of using OpsChain with [Terraform](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-terraform), [Ansible](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-ansible), [Confluent](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-confluent) and [HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-vault) to try out.

## We love feedback

We want to encourage you to try out OpsChain. Try out the examples and see how you could take advantage of OpsChain as part of your activities. In exchange, we are seeking your feedback to help us improve OpsChain even further :-).

We want to hear from you; the good, the bad, and the ugly. All feedback is welcome and cherished. Tell us what you think works well, what are you unsure about, what couldn’t you do, what do you wish it could do?

### How to lodge feedback

You can reach us via Slack on the #opschain-trial channel or send us an email at [opschain-support@limepoint.com](mailto:opschain-support@limepoint.com).

### Surveys

You can also expect a survey or two along the way; don’t worry, we won’t spam you or hassle you. But we do ask for your participation to help us determine general trends for us to focus on.

### Help! Who to contact for support

We are based in Melbourne, Australia so typically, responses would be local business hours.
