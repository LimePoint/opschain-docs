# Overview

Upon [logging in](/getting-started/familiarisation/gui/login.md), you are first taken to the activity screen, which lists all the changes and workflow runs that are available to you. The left pane, used for navigation, lists the operations you can perform. The top pane allows you to log out, as well as condense the navigation bar thereby gaining more screen real estate.
