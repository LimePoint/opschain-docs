# Properties and settings

## Properties

A set of properties can be specified against projects, environments and assets. The properties are then available to the actions that are executed within the respective scope. This allows the running actions to query the properties at runtime to influence the change.

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='Project properties screen' src={require('!url-loader!../images/project-properties.png').default} className='image-border'/>
</p>

Read more about properties in the [properties concept page](/key-concepts/properties.md).

## Settings

Similar to properties, the settings tab allows you to specify configuration options that apply to projects, environments and assets.

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='Project settings screen' src={require('!url-loader!../images/project-settings.png').default} className='image-border'/>
</p>
